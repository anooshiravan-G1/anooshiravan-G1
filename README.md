## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a backend developer currently focused on building robust web applications with ASP.NET Core (MVC). I've recently started diving into ASP.NET Core REST to expand my knowledge and skills in RESTful API development.

### Tech Stack
* Current Focus: ASP.NET Core MVC, ASP.NET Core REST
* Previous Experience: Python & Django for backend development
* Other Interests: Iâ€™ve dabbled in R and explored some foundational concepts in deep learning, though backend development remains my main area of expertise.

### ðŸ’¡ About Me
I began my journey in backend web development with Django and Python and later transitioned to ASP.NET Core to broaden my expertise. I have also explored various fields in tech, from R programming to basic deep learning concepts, though backend development remains my primary focus.

### ðŸš€ Goals for GitHub
I use GitHub as a platform to:

* Share projects: Showcasing my work as I continue to build and learn in ASP.NET Core.
* Learn from the community: I enjoy exploring other repositories and learning from the different coding styles and solutions shared by other developers.
